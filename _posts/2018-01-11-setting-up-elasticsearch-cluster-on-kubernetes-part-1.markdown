This is the begining of a multiple part series of blog posts going through setting up Elasticsearch cluster in kubernetes. 

Part 1 - Setting up Single Node Elasticsearch
[Part 2 - Setting up Kibana Service](https://chekkan.com/setting-up-elasticsearch-cluster-on-kubernetes-part-2-kibana/)
Part 3 - Kubernetes Configuration Files (Coming Soon)

The main aim of this series of blog posts will be make notes for myself as I try to learn kubernetes and for anyone in the same position. 

In this blog post, I will just concentrate on useful Kubernetes getting started resources, commands, and also with an aim of creating a single node Elasticsearch cluster.

## Getting Started
I found the most helpful resource for me was the [Kubernetes official website](https://kubernetes.io/) for starting to learn kubernetes. Head over to the [Interactive Tutorials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) section of the website and spend time going through all 6 modules to cover the basics. It should only take you 1 - 2 hours. You won't have to install anything to try it out.

The next step I took was followed the [Hello Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/hello-minikube/) tutorial. This helped me to get minikube and kubectl commands installed. (Minikube is the local development Kubernetes environment and kubectl is the command line interface used to interact with Kubernetest cluster).

## Shaving the Yak!

One or two commands that I use in this post will be mac specific. Reference [this guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/hello-minikube/#create-a-minikube-cluster) to get more up to date and OS specific commands. 

Once you've got the tools all installed, you can now follow along these steps to create a single node Elasticsearch cluster.

If you are using Minikube, make sure that its started properly by running this command (for mac):
```Shell
minikube start --vm-driver=hyperkit
```

Now set the Minikube context. The context is what determines which cluster kubectl is interacting with.
```Shell
kubectl config use-context minikube
```

Verify that kubectl is configured to communicate with your cluster:
```Shell
kubectl cluster-info
```

To view the nodes in the cluster, run:
```Shell
kubectl get nodes
```

## Kubernetes Dashboard
Minikube includes the kubernetes dashboard as an addon which you can enable. 

```
minikube addons list 
```
returns 
```
- default-storageclass: enabled
- coredns: disabled
- kube-dns: enabled
- ingress: disabled
- registry: disabled
- registry-creds: disabled
- addon-manager: enabled
- dashboard: enabled
- storage-provisioner: enabled
- heapster: disabled
- efk: disabled
```

You can enable an addon using:
```
minikube addons enable dashboard
```
You can then open the dashboard with command
```
minikube addons open dashboard
```

## Single Node Elasticsearch Cluster
Let's start off by creating a single node elasticsearch cluster. According to the [elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/docker.html), the current version at the time of this writing is 6.1.1. And there are three flavours of docker images. We will just use the basic image which has xpack and free license. 

Run the following command to deploy elasticsearch container into our kubernetes environment exposing just the port 9200. There is no way to expose multiple ports using the `kubectl` command line currently. We will probably revisit this in a later post. 
```Shell
kubectl run elasticsearch --image=docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.2.1 --env="discovery.type=single-node" --port=9200
```

To list your deployments use:
```Shell
kubectl get deployments
```

To list all pods and watch the container getting created:
```Shell
kubectl get pods --watch
```

Save the pod name as a variable for use in later commands.
```Shell
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}')
echo Name of the Pod: $POD_NAME
```
> **Note:** The above command will not work if you have multiple pods.

Now, you can take a look at the logs using the command:
```Shell
kubectl logs $POD_NAME
```

## Expose the cluster
We can verify that the cluster is running by looking at the logs. But, let's check if elasticsearch api is responding first. 

**In a seperate shell window**, excute the following to start a proxy into Kubernetest cluster.
```Shell
kubectl proxy
```
Outputs:
```Shell
Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8001
```

Now, back in the other window, lets execute a `curl` command to get the response from the pod via the proxy.
```Shell
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/default/pods/$POD_NAME/
```
Outputs:
```json
{
  "name" : "xNAF2Lj",
  "cluster_name" : "docker-cluster",
  "cluster_uuid" : "sD73f3CkQJOX3t4sxraSug",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "6.2.1",
    "build_hash" : "7299dc3",
    "build_date" : "2018-02-07T19:34:26.990113Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "7.2.1",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "5.6.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "5.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

Great, everything is working. 

Now, lets expose this deployment to outside of Kubernetes network:
```Shell
kubectl expose deployment elasticsearch --type=LoadBalancer
```

**Pro tip**
Use `MiniKube` to open the service in your default browser.
```Shell
minikube service elasticsearch
```

In my case, the port that was assigned to this pod was `31389`. But, we have elasticsearch cluster now running in Kubernetes!
