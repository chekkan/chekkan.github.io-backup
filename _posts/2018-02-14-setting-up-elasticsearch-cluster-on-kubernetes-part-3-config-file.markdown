[Part 2 - Setting up Kibana Service](https://chekkan.com/setting-up-elasticsearch-cluster-on-kubernetes-part-2-kibana/)
Part 3 - Kubernetes Configuration Files

Now that we have a single node elasticsearch service and kibana to monitor the cluster, lets try to capture the work so far into kubernetes configuration file.

## Kubernetes Configuration File

Our current elasticsearch deployment configuration looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      component: elasticsearch
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        component: elasticsearch
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: elasticsearch
        image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.2.1
        env:
        - name: discovery.type
          value: single-node
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9200
          name: http
          protocol: TCP
```
Our elasticsearch service configuration looks like:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch
  labels:
    component: elasticsearch
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    component: elasticsearch
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 9200
    protocol: TCP
```

Let's save these two configurations into a file called `elasticsearch_deployment.yaml` and `elasticsearch_service.yaml` respectively into a folder called `elasticsearch-k8s`.

```
elasticsearch-k8s
├── elasticsearch_deployment.yaml
└── elasticsearch_service.yaml
```

Let's delete the elasticsearch deployment and service that was created before:
```Shell
kubectl delete deployment elasticsearch
kubectl delete service elasticsearch
```

To create the resources from the configuration files, run the command from the `elasticsearch-k8s` folder:
```Shell
kubectl create -f .
```
Outputs:
```
deployment "elasticsearch" created
service "elasticsearch" created
```

Let's do the same for kibana.

Kibana deployment:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: kibana
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: kibana
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: kibana
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kibana
        image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:6.2.1
        env:
        - name: ELASTICSEARCH_URL
          value: http://elasticsearch:9200
        - name: XPACK_SECURITY_ENABLED
          value: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5601
          name: http
          protocol: TCP
```

Kibana service:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kibana
  labels:
    run: kibana
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    run: kibana
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 5601
    protocol: TCP
```

Now you can easily delete and recreate these resource using the commands `kubectl delete -f .` and `kubectl create -f .` respectively. 

In the next post of the series, I will try to change the elasticsearch deployment configuration into a statefulset.
