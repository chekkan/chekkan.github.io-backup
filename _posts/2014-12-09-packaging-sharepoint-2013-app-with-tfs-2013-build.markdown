If you have wondered why the tfs drop folder doesn't contain the app.publish folder like it does when you run the command `msbuild.exe /p:IsPackaging=true /p:OutputPath="D:\dev\"` in your local machine, it's because the property `/p:PublishDir` also needs to be set in addition to `/p:IsPackaging=true`.

So, your continuous integration build definition should have the following msbuild arguments
```
/p:IsPackaging=true /p:PublishDir="$(TF_BUILD_BINARIESDIRECTORY)"\app.publish\`
```
Notice that I am using one of the [TFS Build Environment variables](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/hh850448.aspx) to set the value of `/p:PublishDir` property. So that the tfs build will package the web site and SharePoint app to the binaries directory. The contents of the `TF_BUILD_BINARIESDIRECTORY` is then copied to your drop folder.

Hope this has been helpful as it has caused me a lot of headache to find out.
