I recently started working on a complex ASP.NET MVC 5 Project with Entity Framework 6. This is the first time I am building an actual, to be production ready, deliverable web site on MVC. Of course, there are a lot of challenges and I am battling my way out of each one at a time. One of these challenges was working with Entity Framework and seeding dummy data using code first migration. I found really hard to keep track of the relationships, and the errors were mounting up . And no one wanted to dig their hand into the mess.

Here are three of the most common errors I encountered over and over. Each time I fixed the issue, I didn't feel in power and fixing it felt like a miracle. Glad that part is over.

The datetime2 to datetime conversion.
-- Package Manager Console: Have you forgot to initialize a DateTime property with value?
-- Me: maybe... I don't know. Which fields did I forget?
-- Package Manager Console: I am not going to tell you.

Foreign key constraint, insert command terminated
-- Me: great what was the actual INSERT Statement that caused this issue? So that i can find the seed data and fix it.
-- Package Manager Console: no, you can't ask me that question. I wont show you the insert statement.

Sequence contains more than one element (or something of that sort)?

At this point, the <code>Seed</code> method was populating ten different tables, which had very complex relationships in them. The method was more than 200 lines long. Each time we did an <code>Update-Database</code>, we would get an error, that much was guaranteed. 

How would you debug the database seeding?
I did find some [discussions](http://stackoverflow.com/a/17492050/2267450) in Stack Overflow around adding logging into the Seed method and using the executable program that comes with code first migration. I did not want to try these methods and see how useful they are. You might want to try these out and probably share it with me here?

But, the way I came up with a solution was by thinking that there is a lot of code in this single method. Is there any way to separate these out and make it easy to work with?

Hence, I started creating classes for each of the tables that needed to get seeded. I later realized that these classes need dependency on other tables because of the foreign keys. I was happy with the end result. I am not sure if this is the best way or if there is an even better way to organize the seed methods. I did not find any anywhere. If there is, please do share them with me.

Here is the <code>Seed</code> method after the clean up

```csharp
protected override void Seed(Data.McrsDbContext context)
{
  var users = new UserSeedData().ToArray();
  var meetings = new MeetingSeedData(users).ToArray();
  var actions = new ActionSeedData(users, meetings).ToArray();

  context.Users.AddOrUpdate(user => user.Id, users);
  context.Meetings.AddOrUpdate(meeting => meeting.Id, meetings);
  context.Actions.AddOrUpdate(log => log.Id, actions);
}
```
All of the <code>SeedData</code> classes implement `IEnumerable`. ActionSeedData's constructor for example, has dependency on both users and meetings. In the code below, I am creating 5 random actions for each meeting.

```csharp
public class ActionSeedData : IEnumerable<Action>
{
  private readonly List _data = new List();

  public ActionSeedData(User[] users, Meeting[] meetings)
  {
    var r = new Random();

    _data = Enumerable.Range(1, 5*meetings.Count()).Select((a, idx) => new Action
    {
      Id = idx + 1,
      Title = string.Format("Action.{0}.{1}.{2}", r.Next(1, 10), r.Next(1, 10), r.Next(1, 10)),
      CreatedBy = users[r.Next(0, 7)],
      DueDate = DateTime.Now.AddDays(r.Next(1, 10)),
      MeetingId = meetings[r.Next(0, meetings.Count())].Id,
      ...
    }).ToList();
  }

  public IEnumerator GetEnumerator()
  {
    return _data.GetEnumerator();
  }

  IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()
  {
    return GetEnumerator();
  }
}
```
How is this helping you debug, you might ask. If you get one of the errors mentioned above, you can now easily comment out the bit of `context.AddOrUpdate()`, run the `Update-Database` command, and see if that has fixed the issue. You can now narrow down to the specific table which has got the foreign key constraint error or the `datetime2` conversion error.
Not only that, if you want to spend more time on implementing more complex ways of creating dummy data such as getting a list of phrases from an XML and randomly assigning it to the title of the action? Adding another table to the Seed method should not be a hassle any more. This approach together with logging support should also be interesting.
